Clinicians and local government need to know what trials are taking place in their community to ensure that the right patients receive the right exploratory treatment, while philanthropists and Federal policymakers deserve a one-stop shop to determine which are the most promising early phase treatment results.\n\nFunded in part by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a leader in global health solutions, this live dashboard offers an overview of all the trials taking place in the international effort to tackle the pandemic. One of the most difficult challenges facing those seeking a COVID-19 treatment is how little data exists about this disease.

Ultimately, FDSA will help the research community convert data into breakthroughs that transform people&amp;rsquo;s health. \n\nThe FDSA is a plug-in for data stores that enables data contributors to easily publish remote datasets, making previously inaccessible research data available for discovery and analysis. Data contributors add their metadata to the AD Workbench catalog so researchers can discover, request, and access these remote datasets. FDSA supports interoperability across platforms while prioritising data security. Designed with a user-centric approach, it minimises the workload for data contributors while allowing them to manage data access requests and audit analyses in a streamlined way. \n\nThrough the AD Workbench, researchers can discover FDSA-enabled remote datasets, request access to those datasets, use a tool called Query Builder to perform remote queries, and conduct research analyses from AD Workspace.","tech_stack":"Bash","programming_languages":[],"type_category":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":2,"description":"Resources for health data researchers to conduct in-depth analysis and modeling.

Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.","category":{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":3,"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","name":"infographic"},"tag":[],"datasets":[],"license":{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T13:14:21.000000Z","origin":"EU","valid_until":null,"label":"Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","created_at":"2024-10-08T13:14:21.000000Z","definition":"CC BY-NC 3.0 lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the author’s work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge the author and be non-commercial, they don’t have to licence their derivative works on the same terms.","valid_since":"2007-02-23 00:00:00","deleted_at":null,"verified":1,"id":69,"code":"CC_BYNC_3_0"},"programming_packages":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":11,"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","name":"Webpage","pivot":{"tool_id":157,"programming_package_id":11}}]},{"name":"ARX Data Anonymization","id":158,"description":"Scalable Data Anonymization Tool - supports multiple privacy models.\n\nARX is a comprehensive open source software for anonymizing sensitive personal data.

ARX can be used to remove direct identifiers (e.g. names) from datasets and to enforce further constraints on indirect identifiers. Indirect identifiers (or quasi-identifiers, or keys) are attributes that do not directly identify an individual but may together with other indirect identifiers form an identifier that can be used for linkage attacks.

Owing to the privatised nature of the water industry in the United Kingdom, the required catchment area datasets are not readily available to researchers. Here, we present a consolidated dataset of 7,537 catchment areas from ten sewerage service providers in the Great Britain, covering more than 96% of the population of England and Wales. We develop a geospatial method for estimating the population resident within each catchment from small area population estimates generated by the Office for National Statistics. The method is more widely applicable to matching electronic health records to wastewater infrastructure. Population estimates are highly predictive of population equivalent treatment loads reported under the European Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. We highlight challenges associated with using geospatial data for wastewater-based epidemiology.","category":{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:35:24.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":6,"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:35:24.000000Z","name":"Code snippet"},"tag":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:35:14.000000Z","deleted_at":null,"enabled":true,"id":2,"type":"topics","description":"COVID-19","created_at":"2024-10-08T11:35:14.000000Z","pivot":{"updated_at":null,"deleted_at":null,"tag_id":2,"created_at":null,"tool_id":192}},{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:37:07.000000Z","deleted_at":null,"enabled":true,"id":205,"type":"features","description":"Geospatial Modeling","created_at":"2024-10-08T11:37:07.000000Z","pivot":{"updated_at":null,"deleted_at":null,"tag_id":205,"created_at":null,"tool_id":192}},{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:37:47.000000Z","deleted_at":null,"enabled":true,"id":292,"type":"features","description":"National Core Studies","created_at":"2024-10-08T11:37:47.000000Z","pivot":{"updated_at":null,"deleted_at":null,"tag_id":292,"created_at":null,"tool_id":192}}],"datasets":[],"license":{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:09.000000Z","origin":"HDR","valid_until":null,"label":"Available upon request","created_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:09.000000Z","definition":"Access to the software/code/tool is made available via a request and approval mechanism.

The three main components include the UK HDR Alliance of data custodians, committed to making health data available for research and innovation purposes for public benefit while ensuring safe use of data and building public trust, the HDR Hubs, as centres of expertise for curating data and providing expert domain-specific services, and the HDR Innovation Gateway ('Gateway'), providing discovery, accessibility, security and interoperability services. To support CBK developments, HDR UK is encouraging use of open data standards for research purposes, with guidance around areas in which standards are emerging, aims to work closely with the international CBK community to support initiatives and aid with evaluation and collaboration, and has established a phenomics workstream to create a national platform for dissemination of machine readable and computable phenotypical algorithms to reduce duplication of effort and improve reproducibility in clinical studies.","publication_type":"Research articles","deleted_at":null,"team_id":null,"id":296}],"url":"https://hdruk.github.io/schemata-2/","results_insights":"Please find schema definitions and change logs for all schemas that be handled by the HDRUK Gateway","category":[],"tag":[],"datasets":[],"license":[],"programming_packages":[]},{"name":"Information for care professionals","id":235,"description":"Information for care professionals: Information Sharing, Dashboard User Guides, Support Material, Login to WSIC dashboards and WSIC Request for Change (RFC) Form","tech_stack":null,"programming_languages":[],"type_category":[],"publications":[],"url":"https://www.nwlondonics.nhs.uk/professionals/whole-systems-integrated-care-wsic/information-care-professionals","results_insights":"Information for care professionals:\nInformation Sharing\nDashboard User Guides, Video&#039;s &amp; Support Material\nLogin to WSIC dashboards\nWSIC Request for Change (RFC) Form","category":[],"tag":[],"datasets":[],"license":[],"programming_packages":[]},{"name":"Whole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health Analytics","id":236,"description":"Whole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health Analytics","tech_stack":null,"programming_languages":[],"type_category":[],"publications":[],"url":"https://wsicanalytics.nw.london.nhs.uk/#/site/PopulationHealth/views/LandingPage/Homepage?:iid=2","results_insights":"Whole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health AnalyticsvWhole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health Analytics","category":[],"tag":[],"datasets":[],"license":[],"programming_packages":[]},{"name":"Whole Systems Integrated Care (WSIC) Dashboards - Population Health Analytics","id":237,"description":"The Population Health Landing Page is a WSIC Dashboard Landing Page available for WSIC non-PID (population Health) users. \nThe dashboards displayed there provide aggregate level of data without breaking into individual patient&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#039;s data.","tech_stack":null,"programming_languages":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":12,"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","name":"Other","pivot":{"tool_id":237,"programming_language_id":12}}],"type_category":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":8,"description":"Resources for generating insightful reports and visualizations from health research data.

Prescribing information includes structured data and unstructured free-text instructions, which can include inherent variability, such as \"one to two tablets up to four times a day\". Preparing drug exposure data from raw prescriptions to a research ready dataset is rarely fully reported, yet assumptions have considerable implications for pharmacoepidemiology. This may have bigger consequences for \"pro re nata\" (PRN) drugs. Our aim was, using a worked example of opioids and fracture risk, to examine the impact of incorporating narrative prescribing instructions and subsequent drug preparation assumptions on adverse event rates.<h4>Methods</h4>R-packages for extracting free-text medication prescription instructions in a structured form (doseminer) and an algorithm for transparently processing drug exposure information (drugprepr) were developed. Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD was used to define a cohort of adult new opioid users without prior cancer. A retrospective cohort study was performed using data between January 1, 2017 and July 31, 2018. We tested the impact of varying drug preparation assumptions by estimating the risk of opioids on fracture risk using Cox proportional hazards models.<h4>Results</h4>During the study window, 60 394 patients were identified with 190 754 opioid prescriptions. Free-text prescribing instruction variability, where there was flexibility in the number of tablets to be administered, was present in 42% prescriptions. Variations in the decisions made during preparing raw data for analysis led to marked differences impacting the event number (n = 303-415) and person years of drug exposure (5619-9832). The distribution of hazard ratios as a function of the decisions ranged from 2.71 (95% CI: 2.31, 3.18) to 3.24 (2.76, 3.82).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Assumptions made during the drug preparation process, especially for those with variability in prescription instructions, can impact results of subsequent risk estimates. The developed R packages can improve transparency related to drug preparation assumptions, in line with best practice advocated by international pharmacoepidemiology guidelines.","publication_type":"Research articles","deleted_at":null,"team_id":null,"id":3166}],"url":"https://github.com/belayb/drugprepr","results_insights":"An algorithm for the transparent and efficient preparation of CPRD drug data into information on individuals&rsquo; drug use over time","category":[],"tag":[],"datasets":[],"license":[],"programming_packages":[]},{"name":"Doseminer","id":243,"description":"An R implementation of the text mining algorithm of Karystianis et al.

This should make the tool more portable, extensible and suitable for use across different platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix).","tech_stack":null,"programming_languages":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":9,"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","name":"R","pivot":{"tool_id":243,"programming_language_id":9}}],"type_category":[{"updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:03:14.000000Z","enabled":true,"id":6,"description":"Resources for health researchers to prepare and analyze data with confidence.

Prescribing information includes structured data and unstructured free-text instructions, which can include inherent variability, such as \"one to two tablets up to four times a day\". Preparing drug exposure data from raw prescriptions to a research ready dataset is rarely fully reported, yet assumptions have considerable implications for pharmacoepidemiology. This may have bigger consequences for \"pro re nata\" (PRN) drugs. Our aim was, using a worked example of opioids and fracture risk, to examine the impact of incorporating narrative prescribing instructions and subsequent drug preparation assumptions on adverse event rates.<h4>Methods</h4>R-packages for extracting free-text medication prescription instructions in a structured form (doseminer) and an algorithm for transparently processing drug exposure information (drugprepr) were developed. Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD was used to define a cohort of adult new opioid users without prior cancer. A retrospective cohort study was performed using data between January 1, 2017 and July 31, 2018. We tested the impact of varying drug preparation assumptions by estimating the risk of opioids on fracture risk using Cox proportional hazards models.<h4>Results</h4>During the study window, 60 394 patients were identified with 190 754 opioid prescriptions. Free-text prescribing instruction variability, where there was flexibility in the number of tablets to be administered, was present in 42% prescriptions. Variations in the decisions made during preparing raw data for analysis led to marked differences impacting the event number (n = 303-415) and person years of drug exposure (5619-9832). The distribution of hazard ratios as a function of the decisions ranged from 2.71 (95% CI: 2.31, 3.18) to 3.24 (2.76, 3.82).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Assumptions made during the drug preparation process, especially for those with variability in prescription instructions, can impact results of subsequent risk estimates. The developed R packages can improve transparency related to drug preparation assumptions, in line with best practice advocated by international pharmacoepidemiology guidelines.","publication_type":"Research articles","deleted_at":null,"team_id":null,"id":3166}],"url":"https://github.com/Selbosh/doseminer","results_insights":"Prescribing information includes structured data and unstructured free-text instructions, which can include inherent variability, such as &ldquo;one to two tablets up to four times a day&rdquo;.
